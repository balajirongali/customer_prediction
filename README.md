# Customer Gender Prediction ðŸŽ¯

This project predicts the *gender* of a customer using a machine learning model built with a Gradient Boosting Classifier. The backend is powered by *Flask* and deployed using *Render*. A Flutter-based frontend is also available, making this a complete full-stack machine learning solution.

## ðŸ”— Live Backend

The backend API is live and hosted on Render:

##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher  
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


Running Locally
Run the Flask app:
python main.py

Visit http://localhost:5000 in your browser or use an API client like Postman.

 Frontend
We have built a frontend mobile application using Flutter to interact with this backend API.
This repository only includes the backend code, deployed via Render:
